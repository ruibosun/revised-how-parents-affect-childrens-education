# How Parents may affect Childrens' education

## Overview

This paper explores the relationship between family status variables, such as parents' socio-economic status and educational level, and their impact on children's academic achievement and education level using the data from 2021 GSS. Previous studies have suggested that parents' education can positively influence their children's academic performance due to increased access to resources and greater involvement in their education. However, recent research has demonstrated that this relationship is complex and can be influenced by a variety of psychological and sociological factors. The findings suggest that parents' education, family income, and prestige score all have a positive correlation with children's education. Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of this relationship and use the results to improve educational policies and programs.

The papere used the 2021 General Social Survey (GSS), which is a nationally representative survey conducted to collect data on social trends and attitudes among people living in the United States. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews with adult residents, covering a wide range of variables that are of interest to social scientists, policymakers, and the general public. The variables measured in the survey include demographics, employment, education, health, family, and social attitudes
